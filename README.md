Overview
This repository centers on a practical machine learning task: predicting individual medical insurance charges with a linear regression model. It uses a dataset that captures key demographic and lifestyle attributes. The analysis notebook demonstrates how to clean data, inspect distributions, test assumptions, and build a robust predictive model. The end goal is a transparent, interpretable model that helps stakeholders understand which factors drive costs and by how much.

Why this project exists
Insurance costs affect individuals and families every month. Linear regression offers a simple, interpretable approach to estimate charges based on observable factors. The notebook approach makes it easy to audit the model. You can follow each step, inspect the data, and see how changes in features shift predictions. The project also serves as a template for similar predictive tasks in healthcare and finance where clarity matters.

Data and features
This project uses a synthetic dataset designed to mimic real-world insurance data while preserving privacy. The data model captures common factors that influence charges, such as age, sex, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and geographic region. The target variable is the annual medical insurance charges for an individual.

Core features (typical examples)
- age: Age of the person in years
- sex: Gender category (e.g., male, female)
- bmi: Body mass index
- children: Number of children
- smoker: Smoking status (yes/no)
- region: Geographic region
- charges: Target variable representing annual insurance charges

The notebook demonstrates how to handle categorical features (one-hot encoding or similar encoding strategies), scale numeric features if needed, and manage missing values. The goal is to produce a clean dataset ready for regression modeling, while preserving interpretability.

Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handle missing values with transparent rules (e.g., imputation for numeric features, mode for categorical features)
- Normalize or standardize numeric features when appropriate to improve numerical stability
- Encode categorical features with simple, interpretable methods (one-hot encoding)
- Detect and address outliers in key features (age, bmi, charges) with robust statistics
- Create a clean, well-documented preprocessing pipeline so the same steps can be reproduced on new data

Exploratory data analysis
- Univariate analysis: distributions for age, bmi, charges, and other features
- Bivariate relationships: charges vs age, charges vs bmi, charges vs smoker status
- Categorical feature inspection: how region and smoker status relate to charges
- Correlation analysis to identify linear relationships and potential multicollinearity
- Visual storytelling: clear plots that reveal patterns while remaining accessible

Feature engineering and selection
- Interaction terms: age Ã— smoker, bmi Ã— smoker for potential combined effects
- Binning continuous variables where meaningful (e.g., age groups) for interpretability
- Polynomial features limited to avoid overfitting in a simple linear model
- Feature selection guided by domain knowledge and statistical criteria (p-values, adjusted R-squared)
- Regularization considerations: explanation of why plain OLS is favored for interpretability in this context
- A transparent rationale for keeping or removing features based on their contribution to the model

Modeling approach
- Model type: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression
- Assumptions: linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality of residuals
- Training pipeline: split data into train/validation (and optionally test) sets
- Diagnostic checks: residual plots, Q-Q plots, and leverage analysis to identify influential points
- Data leakage prevention: ensure the training data is separated from any test data to avoid optimistic performance estimates
- Interpretability: coefficient estimates provide direct insights into how each feature affects charges
- Reproducibility: a fixed random seed for data splitting and model fitting ensures consistent results

Evaluation and interpretation
- Metrics used: RMSE, MAE, and R-squared
- Baseline vs enhanced models: comparison to show the impact of feature engineering
- Interpretability of coefficients: explain how to read a coefficient (e.g., the effect of being a smoker on charges)
- Model limitations: discuss the extent to which linear assumptions hold and where the model may fall short
- Hold-out evaluation: emphasis on a robust evaluation strategy that mirrors real-world use

Reproducing results
This project is designed for reproducibility. The analysis notebook contains all the steps from raw data loading to final evaluation. To reproduce results, follow the setup and run instructions in the notebook. All code and results are consolidated in the analysis notebook for transparency and auditability.

- The notebook is the single source of truth for code and results.
- Steps to reproduce are described in the setup section below, with commands you can copy and run in a terminal or notebook cell.
- If you want to inspect individual components, the src folder contains modular scripts for preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation.

Visualization and storytelling
Clear visuals help communicate findings. The notebook includes several plots:
- Scatter plots of charges against key numerical features
- Box plots for charges by categorical categories (e.g., region, smoker)
- Residual diagnostics to assess model fit
- Partial dependence-like visuals showing the marginal effect of selected features
- A summary figure that translates numerical results into actionable insights

The visuals emphasize accessibility. They use concise labels, readable color palettes, and captions that explain what each plot communicates. The goal is to help stakeholders grasp the main drivers of charges without wading through technical details.

Technical architecture and rationale
- Data handling: The pipeline is designed to be understandable and auditable. It uses a straightforward two-step approach: clean data to a stable form, then train a model on the cleaned data.
- Feature pipeline: Categorical features are encoded to preserve interpretability. Numeric features are kept in their natural scale where possible to support direct interpretation of coefficients.
- Model choice: Linear regression is chosen for its transparency. Stakeholders can observe how each feature influences charges, in dollar terms.
- Diagnostics: The notebook includes practical checks for model adequacy. It shows how to interpret residuals and verify assumptions.
